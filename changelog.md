Please read these notes when updating your project's `iohk-nix`
version. There may have been changes which could break your build.

## 2019-07-22
   * The `check-hydra` CI script has been updated in
     [PR #131](https://github.com/input-output-hk/iohk-nix/pull/131).
     It should work in much the same way as before, but can push fixes
     to PR branches if credentials for the repo have been installed on
     the Buildkite agents.
